## Deployment Instructions

### Netlify Deployment
1. Ensure that your serverless functions are placed in the `netlify/functions` directory.
2. Configure your `netlify.toml` file to specify build settings and redirects.
3. Link your Git repository to Netlify and deploy the project.
4. Test the API endpoints to ensure they work correctly.

### Vercel Deployment
1. Ensure that your serverless functions are accessible in the `api` directory.
2. Configure your `vercel.json` file to define routes and serverless functions.
3. Link your Git repository to Vercel and deploy the project.
4. Test the API endpoints to ensure they work correctly.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Run the application locally using `npm start` (if applicable).
- Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## Testing
Make sure to test both deployment options to ensure that the API endpoints work correctly in both environments.
